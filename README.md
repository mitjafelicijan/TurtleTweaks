# TurtleTweaks

**World of Warcraft Tweaks and Enhancements addon.**

**Consideration:** Please note that this addon is not designed to compete with 
any other addon. It is simply a compilation of tweaks and enhancements that I 
have found to be useful. If you require additional functionality, I suggest 
checking out [ShaguTweaks](https://shagu.org/ShaguTweaks/), an outstanding addon 
that has been a source of inspiration for me. My approach is to prioritize 
simplicity and lightness. I avoid including features that I don't personally 
use. As a result, I don't use many other addons either. My addon provides 
only a few quality of life improvements.

Please note that none of the options are enabled by default, and you will need 
to manually opt-in to each one. I designed it this way to align with the 
vanilla experience and avoid forcing pre-selected preferences on users.

## Compatibility

This addon works with the following clients:
- World of Warcraft (client version 1.12 / TurtleWoW)
