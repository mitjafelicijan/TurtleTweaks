# TurtleTweaks

World of Warcraft (client version 1.12 / TurtleWoW) Tweaks and Enhancements addon.

**Consideration:** Please note that this addon is not designed to compete with 
any other addon. It is simply a compilation of tweaks and enhancements that I 
have found to be useful. If you require additional functionality, I suggest 
checking out [ShaguTweaks](https://shagu.org/ShaguTweaks/), an outstanding addon 
that has been a source of inspiration for me. My approach is to prioritize 
simplicity and lightness. I avoid including features that I don't personally 
use. As a result, I don't use many other addons either. My addon provides 
only a few quality of life improvements.

**None** of the options are enabled by default. You have to **opt-in** to each 
one. This kind of chims with the vanilla experience and I don't want to force
pre-selected preferences on anyone.

## Features

- Rested XP display in the Player unit frame.
- Displays number of free bag slots in the backpack button.
- Opens loot window at current mouse position.
- Adds a bunch of slash commands for various things:
  - `/addons` - List all currently loaded addons
  - `/reloadui`, `/reload`, `/rl` - Reload the UI
